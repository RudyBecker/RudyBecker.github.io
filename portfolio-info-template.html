    <p><b>Demo Details :</b> This demonstration shows all features of the pig latin translator working accurately and efficiently. </p>
    <p><b>My contributions to the project :</b> This project was created with two other fellow student at LEARN Academy in San Diego, CA. I worked collaboratively with my teammate to design the logic necessary to build a functioning translator. We collaboratively learned RegEx from scratch and utilized its features in this project. In addition I assisted with CSS styling and conceptual wireframing. </p>
    <p><b>Future Features:</b> 1) Creation of a log to display the history of the words generated by User </p>
